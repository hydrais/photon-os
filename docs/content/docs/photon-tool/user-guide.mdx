## Key Targeting System

Most commands (except beacon, scan, and land) use an intelligent key finding system:

- **Partial name**: Works if the target is within 96 meters of you
- **Full name**: Works sim-wide (and in some cases grid-wide)
- **"all"**: Targets everyone within 96 meters
- **"self"**: Targets yourself
- **"$lusr"**: Targets the last user found

For simplicity's sake, we use NAME for all commands that use this system in their examples.

---

## Basic Operators

These examples show how to provide names for commands:

| Example                       | Description                                                     |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `-trap wrain`                 | Works within 96 meters (partial name)                           |
| `-trap wrainwright mavendorf` | Works sim-wide (full name)                                      |
| `-trap !wrain`                | Traps anyone _without_ "wrain" in their name (within 96 meters) |
| `-trap all`                   | Traps everyone within 96 meters                                 |
| `-trap self`                  | Traps yourself                                                  |
| `-trap last`                  | Traps the last person targeted                                  |

## General Notes

- All commands may be typed on channel 8 (`/8 command`) for privacy.
- Use the variable `$lcmd` to reference the last executed command.
